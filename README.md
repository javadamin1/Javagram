# Javagram Real Time Chat microservice

Javagram is a backend-focused real-time messaging project built with Java 17 and Spring Boot.

The goal of this project is to explore the design and implementation of scalable, production-ready real-time systems using modern Java and containerized environments.

This repository currently contains the foundational project setup, including:
- Maven-based project structure
- Spring Boot application bootstrap
- Docker and Docker Compose configuration
- PostgreSql database

Features such as WebSocket messaging, authentication, persistence, and distributed messaging will be added incrementally as part of a project-driven learning process.
